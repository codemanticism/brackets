# brackets
Brackets dectect brackets boundaries and bracket imbalance

This piece of software was written in python for applications needing dectection of brackets inside of brackets such as languages for programming, formatting, etc..., it can only dectect different bracket levels, so this could be useful to run something in brackets if a condition is met

I may port this into other plataforms
